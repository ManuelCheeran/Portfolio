<p>I’m Manuel Joseph, a B.Tech Computer Science graduate from Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology, Thrissur, Kerala. My journey into web development has been driven by a deep passion for building user-friendly, responsive, and innovative web applications.  </p>

<p>I had the incredible opportunity to enhance my skills as a student intern at Luminar Technolab, Kochi, where I specialized in ME(A)RN stack development. Through hands-on projects and real-world experience, I gained a solid foundation in building full-stack applications, working with technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.  </p>

<p>Beyond coding, I love pushing my limits — whether it’s learning advanced web technologies, exploring creative problem-solving, or staying active through swimming and working out. I’m always eager to grow, collaborate, and turn creative ideas into impactful digital experiences.</p>  

<p>Let’s connect and build something amazing!  </p>
